    "infoBody": "It is a system created to request the validation of your profile in Proof of Humanity through the allocation of an economic incentive.",
    "motivation": "Motivation",
    "motivationTitle": "Why is the Vouch Market being created?",
    "motivationBody": "Proof of Humanity and the UBI are elements that seek to address the greatest number of human beings in these large projects. Taking into account that the number of potential users contemplates precisely all the people on the planet, it is necessary to build tools that complement the intrinsic incentives of the protocol and at the same time build tools that combat the disincentives of the protocol.\n\nOne of these disincentives is the Vouch.\n\nVouching is declared as an altruistic component in the conception of the protocol.\n\nIt manifests itself as the ability to vouch for the humanity of one human being for another human being.\n\nThe problem is that the use of this procedure is recommended only when there is certainty that it is used on a non-malicious actor. In other words, trusting that it is used on the profile of a live person and that it does not violate the protocol in the form of a duplicate or deepfake. The penalty for giving the vouch to such a malicious actor is the suspension of the user from the system.\n\nFurthermore, registration on Proof of Humanity generates new profiles, and these profiles receive a constant issuance of UBIs, increasing the total supply of UBIs, which could generate a perception of depreciation on the token. This scheme discourages part of the registered population from wanting to onboard more users to the ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, the project is in early stages of deployment and development, which explains the low number of users at the moment (taking into account the potential population of the project), a situation that converges in turn with the rate of adoption and use of cryptocurrencies on the Internet, which is limited, making it difficult to have environments and communities with the ability to participate in the program. These characteristics make it very unlikely to have an known person who is already registered in the project.\n\nUnderstanding then the disincentives to give the vouch, coupled with the population capable of issuing it, a major bottleneck on the adoption of the project arises.\n\nThe Vouch Market emerges as a need of the protocol in its initial stages to encourage the use of the vouch, which translates into a higher growth rate of registered users. And in turn in greater incentives for being in Proof of Humanity, since by being part of it, you can choose to give the Vouch in exchange for rewards and collaborate with the token economy.",
    "rewards": "Rewards",
    "rewardsTitle": "Can I make money with this?",
    "rewardsBody1": "Yes, the VouchMarket is designed to benefit everyone.\n\nEvery time a proposal is created using this system, a minimum of ETH is deposited, of which:\n\n◉ 75% goes to the person who locks the proposal and makes the vouch.\n\n◉ 20% is used to burn UBIs in the UBIburner contract ",
    "rewardsBody2": "◉ 5% remains as a contract usage fee in favor of the maintainer.\n\n◉ And at the end the person who makes the proposal is now validated to receive UBIs. Note the fact that in addition the person collaborated with the token economy by using a significant part of the deposit to burn UBIs.\n\nSo everybody wins.",
    "guide1": "Guide - Proposal",
    "guide1Title": "How to create a proposal?",
    "guide1Body1": "If you want to receive a vouch you must create a proposal, the process is as follows:\n\nConnect using MetaMask on the Connect button.",
    "guide1Body2": "Then create a new proposal using the + button at the bottom right.",
    "guide1Body3": "You will be asked for the deposit that you are willing to provide for a potential validator to accept your proposal. Keep in mind that the deposit must be enough for him to cover 2 transactions in Ethereum, one to lock the proposal and the other to collect it (after validating you correctly), in addition to the contract fees.\n\nThe deposit to the voucher and the contract fee fields will be filled in automatically.",
    "guide1Body4": "Then choose the number of days you want your proposal to be valid in the system, so if someone accepts your proposal, but then does not validate it, you will be able to withdraw the deposit (the part corresponding to the voucher). Keep in mind that if it has not been locked, you can withdraw or update it whenever you want.",
    "guide1Body5": "Optional, if you agree with someone to validate your profile, then you could put their address in the 'Designated Voucher' section, and inform them to validate you. This will save him an extra transaction since your proposal will be automatically locked and the only one with the power to validate and collect it will be him. And you could provide a lower deposit due to this, saving you money.",
    "guide1Body6": "Accept the transaction and you're done. It is only a matter of time for someone to validate your proposal and you start receiving UBIs.",
    "guide2": "Guide - Validate",
    "guide2Title": "How to earn money validating?",
    "guide2Body1": "If you are already registered in Proof of Humanity and you have the vouch open, you can earn money by giving your vouch to the proposals, for this you must first lock them and then give them your vouch, the process is as follows:\n\nConnect using MetaMask on the Connect button.",
    "guide2Body2": "Then look for a proposal that is open and has enough time for you to carry out the process, at least 2 days that remain for the proposal should be enough since you can only claim the proposal once the profile is in 'Pending Registration'. (Important: after the deadline, if the proposal has not been claimed, the proposer may remove or modify it. So, ensure to claim it on time)",
    "guide2Body3": "Check that the profile is correct, and help yourself with the similar face detector.",
    "guide2Body4": "Lock the proposal by clicking on the padlock and executing the transaction. This with the aim that it is you and only you who can claim the reward.",
    "guide2Body5": "Keep in mind that each time you lock a proposal, at least 3.5 days must pass and your vouch should not being used by another profile for the system to allow you to lock another one. This in order to prevent someone from locking all existing proposals, and it takes a long time before users can be validated",
    "guide2Body6": "Once locked, vouch the profile.",
    "guide2Body7": "Now, thanks to the automatic process of mobilizing profiles, just wait for the profile to go to 'Pending Registration', or if you prefer (and the deposit is enough) you can mobilize it yourself.",
    "guide2Body8": "And ready. Claim the reward.",
    "guide2Body9": "Optional, you could also offer your vouch to people interested in receiving it so that they can enter your address as 'Designated Voucher', in this way you will save the transaction locking proposal and they could save a little on the deposit.",
    "guide3": "Guide - Modify",
    "guide3Title": "Can I modify a proposal?",
    "guide3Body1": "Yes, you can modify it when it is not locked. If the proposal is locked you must wait for the time limit to expire before you can make any changes to it.\n\nThe procedure, as in previous guides, is to first connect to your MetaMask account. Then, click on the clock icon in your proposal.",
    "guide3Body2": "This will display a modal with the previous proposal data. For this example, we assume that you had already deposited 0.01 ETH when you made the proposal. We will now add 0.01 ETH more, this will cause the balances to update automatically.",
    "guide3Body3": "In this form you can add more ETH or change the number of days the proposal will be available for (Note that the days are not added to the previous days as it happens with the ETH added to the previous ETH)\n\nSubmit it and accept the transaction.\n\nThat's it, the proposal will have been modified successfully.",
    "guide4": "Guide - Delete",
    "guide4Title": "Can I delete a proposal?",
    "guide4Body1": "Yes, you can delete it when it is not locked.\nIf the proposal is locked you must wait until the time limit you set, expires before you can delete it. Keep in mind that if you delete a proposal you will receive the deposit corresponding to the voucher part, the contract will still charge the fee for burning UBIs and for the maintainer.\n\nThe procedure, as in previous guides is to first connect to your MetaMask account.\n\nThen, click on the trash can icon and accept the transaction.",
    "guide4Body2": "That's it, you will receive the corresponding deposit and your proposal will no longer be available.",
